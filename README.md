## My process
I started out by using bootstrap cards to make an outline for the compenent and getting all te text and images to match the design. I then had to do alot of looking into the range slider fill as it progress beacuse the defualt css functionality doesn't work on most browsers. I found some good code pens doing exactly what I need and so I learned from them and changed it to what I need. I then worked on the toggle button and same thing looking up how to do something like that. Afer I got this buttons working I worked on the javascript to make the range slider values work correctly. I went with the easiest way and did a switch stament that depends on the range slider value to display the proper amount of page views and an if statement to check if the yearly subscribtion button was checked.
